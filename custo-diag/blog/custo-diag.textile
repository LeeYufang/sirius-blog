h1. Customize diagrams with images

h2. Images in existing diagram

In a Sirius based editor, the style of each diagram elements can be customized.
This customization can be applied from :
* the tool bar :
!./images/toolbar.png! 
* the @Appearance@ tab of the property view : 
!./images/appearance.png! 
* the @Diagram@ menu :
!./images/diagram.png! 
* the contextual menu @Format@ :
!./images/format.png! 

You can customize on :
* container : background color, background style, border size, foreground color, label alignment, label size, label format and workspace image.
* node : border size, color, label alignment, format, position, size and workspace image.
* edge : the folding style, the color, the label alignment, format, position and size, the line and routing style, the size and the target and source arrow.

If we set a workspace image on the Influence diagram resulting from the "tree layout blog post":http://melb.enix.org/the_tree_layout_secret, we are able to see Frank Underwood face instead of a simple white square.

Theses customizations can be reset by :
* the @Reset style customization@ button available in the @Appearance@ tab of the property view :
!./images/appearance_reset.png!  
* in the diagram editor tool bar :
!./images/toolbar_reset.png!

Thanks to this feature each user can customize existing diagrams in any Sirius based modeler. The problem with this solution is that if you create another diagram, the default style will be applied and so we will not see anymore the beautiful faces of Frank. 

h2. Specify workspace images

What we need is to provide the image during the diagram specification phase to get the image on each new diagram. If we reopen the houseofcards.odesign. We can update the Influence diagram description to use a workspace image in conditional style to represent Frank.
!./images/conditional_styles_specification.png! 

And now each time we create an Influence diagram, we see automatically Frank's and Linda's face. 
!./images/conditional_styles.png!

What is problematic with this solution is that we need to create a conditional style for each characters. As it exists around 50 different characters in the House of cards series, it will be an hard work.

h2. Specify style custo images

Thankfully, for you, Sirius provides another way to do that. We want to provide just all the images in a specific folder and then Sirius must select the good one according to the picture's name. This could be done easily by using the @style customizations@.
We modify our mapping to specify a workspace image style.
!./images/style_custo_mapping.png!

We provide a new style customization.
!./images/style_custo_specification.png!

And a new property customization by expression.
!./images/style_custo_property_specification.png!

All the pictures are stored in an @images@ folder.
./images/style_custo_design_images.png!

Then we specify that the style to customize is the workspace image previously defined.
This style customization must be applied on @PersonWorkspaceImage@ and we want to customize the @workspacePath@ property.
!./images/style_custo_property_specification2.png! 

To retrieve the value of the workspacePath, we call a Java service @getImage@ which returns the image path from the person name.
!./images/style_custo_java.png!

Finally, when we reopen our example, we got a more shiny diagram this time all the persons are represented by an image.
!./images/style_custo_property.png!

With the next Sirius 3.0 version, if you use images with a transparent background, the edges will follow the image.
