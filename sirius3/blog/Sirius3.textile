h1. Sirius 3.0 "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"

Today is a great day: with the announcement of Eclipse Mars, many great projects are released, and Sirius 3.0 is part of this release train.

When I have a look at the status of the Sirius project today, one soundtrack immediately comes to mind: 
"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daft_Punk_-_Harder_Better_Faster_Stronger_(Album_Version).ogg

h2. Work on it harder

One first fact, looking at the project's statistics, is that the Sirius team worked hard on this release to deliver some new cool features and improve the existing ones:

h2. Make it better

Their goal was to provide a better tooling for the end users by improving the diagram user experience. This work started with Sirius 2.0 and some of the following features have been there since then.

h3. Resizing a container

h3. Positioning elements

| _Snap To Shape_ enabled by default for new diagrams|!./images/snap_to_shape.png!|
| _Snap To Grid_ now used when an element is created|!./images/snap_to_grid.png!|
| _Resize_ no longer change ports or children's location|!./images/resize_ports.png!|
| Actions to _distribute_ shapes|!./images/shapes_distribution.png!|
| Action to _reset the diagram origin_|!./images/reset.png!|

h3. Edges layouting

h3. Beautiful editor

The editor was also improved to provide :
* Anchor on borders: Now the edges are linked closely to the images, you just need to define images with an transparent background.
!./images/imageborder-after.png!

* Underlined and strike through style for labels
!./images/underline.png!

* Compartments: There are two new values available for a container mapping @Vertical Stack@ and @Horizontal Stack@. This means that the defined container will show its children as a vertical/horizontal stack of compartments. Thanks to this new feature, you are able to define a dynamic number of compartments.

!./images/compartments.png!

As compartments also use "queries":http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/general/Writing_Queries.html, it is easy to create any "artificial level":http://melb.enix.org/sirius/artificial-container/ of compartments independently from the metamodel structure.

Have a look at the "Sirius compartments documentation":view-source:http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#compartments for more details.

h2. Do it faster

The goal was to be able to manage models with 1 million elements.

Sirius performances are in constant improvements, and this version comes with significant enhancements 
on heap consumption and time execution.
|                           |Time (sec)	|Heap (Mb)	|Time Variation	|Heap Variation|
|Open Huge Project	        |80	        |276	    |-31,00%	    |-20,00%|
|Open Big Class Diagram	    |11      	|24	        |-54,00%	    |+20,00%|
|Refresh Big Class Diagram	|0,731	    |0	        |-18,00%	    |0,00%|
|Save After Diagram Change	|26	        |0	        |-23,00%	    |0,00%|
|Close Diagram	            |0,1	    |-6       	|0,00%	        |0,00%|
|Close Project	            |55	        |294	    |0,00%	        |0,00%|

On big operations, the model footprint is reduced by 20%. To do so, major work was done on:
* using MinimalEObject
* Transforming Colors from full-blown EObject into Immutable DataType
* Detecting and fixing leaks
* Reducing the usage of adapters.

Then the save strategy was reviewed as well as the diagram refresh and the image cache.

Another big task was to reduce the latency. First, on the UI runtime:
* model element selection dialogs must be used for big models.
* the right-click in the explorer was optimized.
* and the property views made with "EEF":https://eclipse.org/eef/ are better integrated.

And then to reduce the latency on tables, SWT refreshes are now done in batch and the team also improved the table model refresh.

Performance is also your matter! It really depends on your .odesign specification. You should focus on queries : measure, improve and repeat! Think about using the Sirius embedded profiler:

h2. Make us stronger

h3. Definition tooling

The Sirius team also works to polish the specifier editor:
* Workspace class loading is BACK: With Sirius 3 you can define Java services and then try them directly in your current development environment, you do not need anymore to launch another runtime just to test your services!
* Image path validation and selection wizard: Now, there is a selection wizard to choose an image and then validation exists on image path. You will never get a _not found _ image.
!./images/image_path_validation.png!
!./images/select_image.png!
* Quick Outline : An awesome improvement: it allows to quickly find any element in a _odesign_! Just call @Ctrl+O@ and a wizard shows up to help you searching through the viewpoint specification.
!./images/quick_outline.png!
* Prioritized sub menus: Another great thing, the menus have been reordered and now the most used elements are available at the top.

h3. Query languages

If you are used to work with Sirius, you already know that writing queries can turn to a severe headache due to _types_.
!./images/queries-in-odesign.png!
Actually, there are in Sirius 5 different interpreters to write your queries:
* Feature: @feature:@
* Service: @service:@
* Var: @var:@
* MTL: @[/]@
* and the legacy one: @<%%>@ 

For example, if we have a look at the following query : _What is the type of var:source?_
!./images/typed-edge-mapping.png!
!./images/typed-edge-creation.png!

Type analysis within the action language requires a stronger type information from interpreters. It is implemented in feature:, var:. We made some improvements in [/] and there is simply no support in legacy <%%> and ocl:. What we want is a good reference support.

The "Acceleo Query Language":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/general/Writing_Queries.html#aql also known as AQL comes to our rescue. The implementation of AQL is specifically tailored for the Sirius use case. We have many variables for a given expression and _null_ values are common. The usage is really interactive and so the context is constantly changing.
I can hear you "Hoooo no, not yet _another_ language...". Don't be afraid! You know OCL ? Then you know AQL.

The most important things to know is that:
* You will find the classic operations like @filter@,  @collect@,
* And some convenient ones as: @eInverse()@, @eResource()@...
* There is *no* implicit variable:

bc. 
[name/] is invalid 
becomes 
self.name

bc. 
[self.eContents()->select(name.startsWith('A'))/] is invalid 
and becomes 
self.eContents()->select(i | i.name.startsWith('A') 

bc. 
self.referenceWithNoValue.someOtherAttribute has no evaluation error, returns "Nothing"

AQL is not strictly compatible with MTL but a subset of MTL works for both.

We did some benchmarks with the different queries engines available in Sirius:
!./images/sirius-query-bench.png!

AQL is very impressive! In Sirius 3.0, it is delivered as an experimental feature.
!./images/install-aql.png!

But it will be available officially for the next 3.1 release, so consider using it from now on if you are still using Acceleo 2 expressions (@<%%>@). Otherwise, if you are using MTL (@[/]@), you can prepare your queries to make the migration easier.

To get more details about what is arriving in Sirius 3.0, have a look at the "release notes":http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/Release_Notes.html and to the "slides":http://cedric.brun.io/talks/ of "CÃ©dric Brun":http://cedric.brun.io/ EclipseCon France talk.
Even if Sirius 3.0 is major version, don't be afraid! The models are automatically migrated by Sirius, the API changes are well documented in the release notes and some projects such as "EcoreTools":http://www.eclipse.org/ecoretools/ or "UML Designer":http://www.umldesigner.org already use it with no major issues.

The 3.1 version is planned for November and the next topics of work will be: more flexibility for diagram UX, compartments feature complete, bullet-proof AQL and again more performance and scalability improvements... and your priority is our priority for the future. So don't be shy and report what you need and want on the "bugzilla":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Sirius
